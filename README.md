Hi, I hope you guys enjoy this website. This is the first ever website that I ever made.

This website in particular was made with ChatGPT-3. This is when ChatGPT just recently came out in November 2022. 

*I remember being in my Pre-Clac class and telling everyone im going to make a website, and im going to complete in a week.*

Thankfully, I was bless enough to finish at that time period I put myself in.

As for how I completed, this website here is the process I took to complete it. 

Note, that I didn't have no coding experience with HTML & CSS and I had no idea how to create a website. 

Just like always, I went in blindfolded into making this project.

First Day 
---------

Watch a Youtube Channel named "CodewithMosh" - HTML and CSS Tutorial

Wrote some notes and start to plan out with my head without writing or drawing a layout of the website 

Later on, that was a problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Day 
----------

After, watching the Youtube video, I tried to make a website.......

I was lost, even though I watched the tutorial, I was still lost. 

Since, the time to finish this project was this week, I had to look up a youtube video on how people start to make a website. 

Meaning a website template of the project 

Then, I saw this Youtube video

I was like 

Me: *Alright, I think got it* 

I proceed to ask code for the first time, and downloading extensions such as Live Server, I started coding without AI. I coded but....

*It was diaster* 

I took me 3 to 5 hours in to the coding that I was making a mistake, that mistake is what I did wrong in the First Day, which was not being able to  
come up with a layout and what did I want the website to do

Thus, I stopped and was thinking......kept on thinking.... then watched a movie..... then came up with a idea 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third day 
---------

Alright, I got the idea. Now, let use this ChatGPT to see what it could do
