Hi, I hope you guys enjoy this website. This is the first ever website that I ever made.

This website in particular was made with ChatGPT-3. This is when ChatGPT just recently came out in November 2022. 

*I remember being in my Pre-Clac class and telling everyone im going to make a website, and im going to complete in a week.*

Thankfully, I was bless enough to finish at that time period I put myself in.

As for how I completed, this website here is the process I took to complete it. 

Note, that I didn't have no coding experience with HTML & CSS and I had no idea how to create a website. 

Just like always, I went in blindfolded into making this project. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First Day 
---------

Watch a Youtube Channel named "CodewithMosh" - HTML and CSS Tutorial

Wrote some notes and start to plan out with my head without writing or drawing a layout of the website 

Later on, that was a problem

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second Day 
----------

After, watching the Youtube video, I tried to make a website.......

I was lost, even though I watched the tutorial, I was still lost. 

Since, the time to finish this project was this week, I had to look up a youtube video on how people start to make a website. 

Meaning a website template of the project 

Then, I saw this Youtube video

I was like 

Me: *Alright, I think got it* 

I proceed to ask code for the first time, and downloading extensions such as Live Server, I started coding without AI. I coded but....

*It was diaster* 

I took me 3 to 5 hours in to the coding that I was making a mistake, that mistake is what I did wrong in the First Day.

Which to come up with a layout and what did I want the website to do.

Thus, I stopped and was thinking......kept on thinking.... then watched a movie..... then came up with a idea 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Third day 
---------

Alright, I got the idea. Now, let use this ChatGPT to see what it could do, this was ChatGPT-3, and at this time I was coding....

and for the first time was using ChatGPT-3 and one thing I realized that you have to say the right question to get what you want. 

At this time, from what I know there wasn't a feature where you could upload images or files. This is all about the prompt. 

The prompt to generate that output that you want....*damnn, that line goes hard* 

After some timing, I was able to produce the front page, then produce the 4 tabs to go to different pages 

Then I chilled 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fourth Day - Fifth Day 
----------------------

At this time, I experience on what people meant "Your in the zone" and I was in the zone, I literally woke up and did my morning

routine and then started to code and code and code. I felt so good and didn't want no one to bother me, I was so in the zone 

where I was like, *hnmmmm... <li></li> so this what you could do to make a list, now I see how people put info on their website*

This is where I started to understand, HTML & CSS on how people use what to put in thier code to achieve the output that they want 

to achieve. When I finally, understood that I was happy :) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sixth - Final Day
-----------------

I finished the website, now is time to host the website live so people could see it around the whole world. 

Now, I had to look this up and when I look this up I use the server and to buy the domain name thephantomneticx.com

I was able to get a server to host the website.

Keynote: Hosting a big website requires a lot of money, which is when I was surprised on how much money this big companies have. 

Is crazy to think about, one of the most important thing is to protect that website from any attackers. Hmmm.... new project :) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final thoughts 
--------------

I love frontend more than backend. I was able to get a internship at BMCC with Prof. Ahzar & Hannah, I was able to create a website

with Ye. Even though, the time was not in our hands it made me realize that I was not a big fan of backend. 

Even though, I am not a big fan of backend, I still need to learn it if I want to code in one of my websites.

Other than that, creating a first project was worth it and I would recommend everyone to do a solo project on your own and use tools 

around you such as Youtube, books, stackoverflow, and any LLM such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Mistral. 

Anyways, if you actually read this from beginning to end then I really apperciate it for taking a time of your day to read this github repo.
